# BridgeLabz SIPP Training Program

Welcome to my **BridgeLabz-SIPP-Training** repository! This project documents my learning journey through structured modules in **Core Java**, **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, **OOPs**, **Searching**, **Sorting**, and **Scenario-Based Problem Solving**.

This repository highlights the concepts I've mastered, hands-on implementations, and real-world problem-solving experiences.

## 📌 Modules Covered

### ☕ Core Java
- Gained a strong foundation in **variables**, **data types**, **operators**, and **control flow statements** (`if-else`, `loops`, `switch`).
- Developed a deep understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles:
  - 🔹 Encapsulation  
  - 🔹 Inheritance  
  - 🔹 Polymorphism  
  - 🔹 Abstraction  
- Worked extensively with **Strings** and **Arrays**.
- Solved real-world problems using **Java’s built-in functions**, enhancing code fluency and debugging skills.

---

### 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- Learned core data structures: **HashMap**, **HashSet**, **LinkedList**, **Stack**, **Queue**.
- Applied these structures in solving computational problems effectively.
- Gained knowledge of **Algorithm Analysis** and **Big O Notation** for writing optimized, scalable code.
- Created a dedicated 📁 `Scenario/` folder with real-life problems based on these concepts.

---

### 🔄 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java
- Practiced and implemented OOP principles:
  - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
- Designed models using:
  - 📐 Class Diagrams  
  - 🧩 Object Diagrams  
  - 🔁 Sequence Diagrams
- Implemented **interface-based** and **modular designs** to ensure reusable, clean architecture.

---

### 🔍 Searching Algorithms
- Implemented and analyzed:
  - **Linear Search** – Time Complexity: `O(n)`
  - **Binary Search** – Time Complexity: `O(log n)`
- Understood the **use-cases and efficiency trade-offs** for each method.

### 🧮 Sorting Algorithms
Implemented and studied the following sorting techniques:

| Algorithm        | Time Complexity (Best/Average/Worst) | Space Complexity | Use Case |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|----------|
| Bubble Sort      | O(n) / O(n²) / O(n²)                 | O(1)             | Simple, small datasets |
| Selection Sort   | O(n²) / O(n²) / O(n²)                | O(1)             | When memory writes are costly |
| Insertion Sort   | O(n) / O(n²) / O(n²)                 | O(1)             | Nearly sorted data |
| Merge Sort       | O(n log n) / O(n log n) / O(n log n) | O(n)             | Stable, large datasets |
| Quick Sort       | O(n log n) / O(n log n) / O(n²)      | O(log n)         | Fast, average-case efficient |
| Heap Sort        | O(n log n) / O(n log n) / O(n log n) | O(1)             | Optimal space, not stable |
| Counting Sort    | O(n + k)                             | O(k)             | Integers in a known range |

- Gained the ability to **choose the optimal sorting technique** based on performance needs and data size.

## 🛠 Workshop – Scenario-Based Problem Solving

Applied Core Java, OOP, DSA, Searching, and Sorting to tackle real-world problems. These scenarios helped solidify my conceptual understanding through implementation of:

- ✅ Arrays & Strings  
- ✅ HashMap & HashSet  
- ✅ Stack & Queue  
- ✅ LinkedList  
- ✅ Interface-based modular design
