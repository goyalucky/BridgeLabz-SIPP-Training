# BridgeLabz-SIPP-Training

This repository showcases my learning journey through various modules that cover the essentials of Core Java, DSA, OOPs, Searching, Sorting, and Scenario-based Problem Solving. Below is a detailed summary of the concepts covered and skills gained.

📌 Modules Covered
☕ Core Java
Mastered the fundamentals of Java: variables, data types, operators, and control flow statements (if-else, loops, switch).

Developed strong understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:

1) Encapsulation
2) Inheritance
3) Polymorphism
4) Abstraction

Worked extensively with Strings and Arrays.

Solved real-world problems and enhanced coding fluency using Java’s built-in functions.

📚 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
Gained theoretical and practical knowledge of:

HashMap, HashSet, LinkedList, Stack, and Queue

Learned to solve computational problems using these data structures.

Studied Algorithm Runtime Analysis and Big O Notation for writing efficient, optimized code.

Created a dedicated 📁 "Scenario" folder to solve real-life problem statements, applying DSA concepts effectively.

🔄 OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming in Java)
Studied and implemented:

1) Encapsulation
2) Inheritance
3) Polymorphism
4) Abstraction

Practiced Object Modeling using:

Class Diagrams

Object Diagrams Sequence Diagrams Implemented interface-based design for modular and reusable code.

🔍 Searching Algorithms
Learned and implemented:

Linear Search – Time Complexity: O(n)

Binary Search – Time Complexity: O(log n)

Understood the real-world applications of each and identified scenarios where each is most suitable.

🧮 Sorting Algorithms
Implemented and analyzed:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Heap Sort

Counting Sort

Understood each algorithm’s:

Use case

Time and space complexity

Gained ability to choose the best sorting method based on input size and performance needs.

🛠 Workshop (Scenario-Based Problem Solving)
Solved case study and real-world scenarios using combined knowledge of:

Core Java

OOPs

DSA

Searching & Sorting

Applied concepts like HashMap, HashSet, Array, String, Stack, Queue, LinkedList.
